## Anything you want to tell us?
- Tools
    - Visual Studio Code
    - https://wave.webaim.org/ for accessibility test

- Frameworks/Libraries
    - Next.js
        - I used Next.js to build on top of React and take advantage of the isomorphic build functionality, the file-system based routing and the ability to add an API structure within this.
        - It allows you to quickly setup your site as a PWA with minimal configuration. 
        - I also used it for its ability to quickly deploy and run serverless on Vercel.
    - Cypress.js
        - As a testing framework built for JavaScript I thought this project would be a good time to explore its implementation. The ability to test it visually and through the CLI were both attractive features.

- Time: 4 days

- Assumptions?
    - For the data from the json file I assumed that all added items had a quantity of 1 and reflected this in the API GET route. I also considered the item with a stock level of 0 should not be displayed as it wouldn't have been able to be added to the cart.

## How would you improve this test?
1. Add an optional step to create a product page for adding to cart
2. Add some product visuals for the cart page layout

### What did you like?
1. Clean and well structured design files
2. A clear task with room to think for yourself in delivering the outcome
3. The structure of the test with some clear tasks and examples to try out if you've got some more time
